"# RewardValue.java
I have created a new java class called 'RewardValue', where 2 constructors , one for creating an instance with a cash value and another for creating an instance with a miles value. The conversion logic is implemented in these constructors, and the getters allow retrieval of the cash and miles values. The conversion rate of 0.0035 is applied consistently in both directions.

RewardValueTest.java

The updated version implements missing conversion tests, verifying accurate cash-to-miles and miles-to-cash conversions.
The convert_from_cash_to_miles test checks the accuracy of converting cash to miles.
The convert_from_miles_to_cash test checks the accuracy of converting miles to cash.
The addition of conversion tests enhances the overall comprehensiveness of the test "
